# cgmpatches
This repo is patches for CGMs to expand the official functions.
You can decompile the official APK and integrate the patches which you want and then compile your own APK.


# What are the patches used for?
1. Send BG to other applications like XDrip+ or AndroidAPS by using local broadcast.
2. With XDrip+ you can expand lots of features like supporting Miband, smart watches to see your BG graphic.
3. You can use it in a closed loop system if you can take your own risk for the accuracy of your CGMs. 
4. Extend your CGM life.
5. Disable auto upgrade functions for the official app.

# Which CGMs are supported?
Currently 硅基(sisensing) and 微泰(Aidex) are supported.
